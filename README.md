=========

Static site generator similar to Jekyll written in Go.

*Note: still in development, everything may be changed without notice.*

No docs yet, but see example website in `example` directory.


## Importing

You can import posts and pages from WordPress using
`kkr import wordpress your_export.xml`, but you should
create `site.yml` first. The importer is currently primitive.
